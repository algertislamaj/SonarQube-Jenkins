# SonarQube Integration Testing Repository

This repository serves as a platform for testing the integration of a Spring Boot backend application and a React frontend application with SonarQube and Jenkins. It facilitates seamless testing and evaluation of code quality metrics for both backend and frontend components.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to evaluate the integration of software projects with SonarQube, an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. By testing the Spring Boot backend and React frontend within the SonarQube environment, developers can gain insights into code issues, technical debt, and overall code quality metrics.

## Contents

The repository contains:

- **Spring Boot Backend Application**: A simple backend application built using the Spring Boot framework.
- **React Frontend Application**: A basic frontend application developed using the React library.

## Getting Started

To begin testing the integration with SonarQube and Jenkins:

1. Ensure you have administrative access to both SonarQube and Jenkins environments.
2. Configure the SonarQube server and Jenkins pipeline to integrate with this repository.
3. Execute the Jenkins pipeline to trigger the SonarQube analysis.
4. Review the generated code quality reports and metrics in the SonarQube dashboard.

## Directory Structure

- `/backend`: Contains the Spring Boot backend application code.
- `/frontend`: Contains the React frontend application code.

## Usage

Follow these steps to initiate the integration testing process:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your SonarQube and Jenkins environments as per the provided configuration.
3. Configure the Jenkins pipeline to trigger the SonarQube analysis on code changes.
4. Run the Jenkins pipeline and monitor the execution.
5. Access the SonarQube dashboard to view the generated code quality reports and metrics.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the SonarQube and Jenkins communities for their continuous support and development of tools for enhancing code quality and continuous integration.
